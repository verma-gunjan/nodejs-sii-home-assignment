- Secure password hashing.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Sequelize
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier

## Prerequisites

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Candidate Assignment Instructions

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your personal GitHub account. Do not clone this repository directly.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine to begin working on the assignment.

3.  **Complete the Tasks**: Follow the setup guide in the "Getting Started" section below. Your main goal is to implement the features listed under "Next Steps / Future Enhancements". We encourage you to attempt as many tasks as your time allows; the more you complete, the better we can assess your skills.

4.  **Submit for Review**: Once you are finished, ensure all your changes are pushed to your forked repository. Then, add `thalesvvikas` as a collaborator to your private forked repository so we can review your work.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thalesvvikas/nodejs-home-assignment.git
cd nodejs-home-assignment
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup PostgreSQL

1.  **Install PostgreSQL**: If you don't have it installed, download it from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. During installation, you will be prompted to set a password for the default `postgres` user.

2.  **Create a database user and database**:
    Open your terminal and use `psql` (PostgreSQL's command-line utility) to create a new user and database. You might need to switch to the `postgres` user first.

    ```bash
    # On macOS (using Homebrew) or Linux
    psql postgres

    # On Windows, you can use the SQL Shell (psql) installed with Postgres.
    ```

    Now, run the following SQL commands. Replace `'your_password'` with a secure password.

    ```sql
    -- Create a new user (role)
    CREATE ROLE taskmanager_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password';

    -- Create the database
    CREATE DATABASE task_manager_db;

    -- Grant all privileges on the new database to the new user
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE task_manager_db TO taskmanager_user;
    ```

### 4. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables. Use the credentials for the database you just created.

```env
# .env

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=taskmanager_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=task_manager_db
DB_PORT=5432

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in production mode.
- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode using `nodemon`. The server will automatically restart if you change any file.
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite using Jest.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.

## API Endpoints

Here are the main API endpoints available:

### Authentication
*   `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user.
*   `POST /api/auth/login` - Login a user and get a JWT token.

### Tasks
*   `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks for the authenticated user.
*   `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task.
*   `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get a single task by ID.
*   `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update a task by ID.
*   `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete a task by ID.

## Project Structure

The main application code is located in the `src/` directory.

```

├── config/       # Database configuration, etc.
├── controllers/  # Request handlers
├── middleware/   # Express middleware (e.g., auth)
├── models/       # Sequelize models
├── routes/       # API routes
├── services/     # Business logic
├── utils/        # Utility functions
└── server.js     # The application entry point
```

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

Here are some suggestions for the next set of tasks for candidates to further enhance the project:

-   **Pagination & Filtering**:
    -   Implement pagination and filtering for the task list endpoint: `/api/tasks?page=1&limit=10&status=pending`.

-   **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    -   Introduce an `admin` role that has privileges to view all tasks from all users.

-   **Soft Deletes**:
    -   Implement a soft delete mechanism. Instead of permanently deleting tasks, mark them as `deleted` and add a `deletedAt` timestamp.

-   **API Documentation**:
    -   Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI to generate interactive API documentation, available at an endpoint like `/api/docs`.

-   **Request Logging**:
    -   Add a request logging middleware using a library like `morgan` or `winston` to log all incoming requests.

-   **Enhanced Unit Test Coverage**:
    -   Expand the Jest test suite to cover the complete authentication flow (login, register) and all CRUD operations for tasks.

-   **Rate Limiting**:
    -   Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints, especially login, to prevent brute-force attacks using a library like `express-rate-limit`.

-   **Asynchronous Job Queue**:
    -   Implement a background job queue for sending email notifications (e.g., on task creation or completion) using a library like `BullMQ` with Redis.

## Extra Merits

-   **Dockerization**:
    -   Create a `Dockerfile` for the Node.js application and a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the application and the PostgreSQL database services.

-   **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
    -   Set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests and lint checks on every push and pull request.
```
## Running the Project with Docker

### Prerequisites
Before running the application in Docker, ensure the following are installed:

| Requirement | Required? | Instructions |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS)** https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ |
| **Docker Compose** Comes bundled with Docker Desktop / Docker Engine |

> **Windows/macOS users must start Docker Desktop before running any docker-compose commands.**

---

### Start Docker (Windows/macOS users)
1. Open **Docker Desktop** from the Start Menu.
2. Wait until it shows: **"Docker is running"**.
3. build and run containers
    docker-compose up --build

### This project uses Nodemailer to send email notifications (e.g., for task creation and updation, user registration confirmation)

# Nodemailer Email Configuration (add in .env)
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
EMAIL_USER=<your-email@example.com>

## This project uses Redis for job queues (via BullMQ). When running with Docker, Redis is included as a service.
# The default host and port in Docker Compose are:
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
